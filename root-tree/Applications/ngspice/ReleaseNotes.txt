Ngspice-31, Oct 6th, 2019
ngspice and nspice-manuals master branches, tag ngspice-31.3
============

- New features:
    + if a subcircuit is defined more than once, only read the first one and discard the others
    + vbic model implementation including self-heating effect
    + Enable the file input as additional search path for .include files also for non-Windows OSs
    + add scope to decks and subcircuits (not yet fully implemented)
    + enable 'res' as valid resistor model identifier
    + Add variable 'nostepsizelimit' to relieve step size limit defined by TSTEP of the .tran command
    + Windows GUI: make GUI more responsive
    + if the comaptibility mode is PS, LTPS or LTPSA, '$' is treated as a valid character, not as
      end-of-line comment delimiter
    + allow very short version information with new options -v and -d to 'version' command
    + the PSPICE area token for a device instance may be not only a number, but also a parametrized
      token like {tok}
    + Windows GUI: New history buffering
    + Windows GUI: Added scrolling to input window
    + update to hicum version 2.40
    + allow " around netnames for .plot and .print commands
    + command 'setcs': like command 'set' but case sensitive
    + linearized cutout of an original vector by defining the vectors lin-tstart, lin-tstop,
      and lin-tstep before sending the 'linearize' command
    + new examples: inverters and ring oscillator using SOI
    + 'option norefvalue' to suppress printing the reference value

- Bug fixes:
    + many bugs fixed and code improvements (patches 33 - 64, bug tracker nos. 390,
      394, 395, 403, 404, 408)
    + memory leaks removed
    + additional bug fixes since releases ngspice-31, ngspice-31-2
