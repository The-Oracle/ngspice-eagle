2. Crucial Differences between Spice3f2 and Spice3f1:
  Addition of DEVunSetup call to ***itf.h files
  The 3f2 input parser can't handle arithmetic operators in strings.
  A special call has been added in spiceitf/inpgval.c to specially
  parse strings.  Quotes (either "foobar" or 'foobar') are stripped
  from the string.
