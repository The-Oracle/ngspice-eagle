Directory: twod
---------------
This directory contains the files that are primarily responsible for
implementing the 2D device simulator. It also contains files that help
interface the circuit simulator to the device simulator. Most functions
that are common to all 2D device simulations start with the prefix TWO,
e.g. TWObiasSolve. The device-specific routines start with either NUMD2,
NBJT2 or NUMOS, e.g. NUMD2admittance, NBJTproject or NUMOSconductance. The
simulator contains a Poisson Solver for equilibrium, and a Two-carrier
solver and One-carrier solvers for bias solutions. An attempt has been
made to keep the function names parallel in the four portions. Poisson
routines are identified with a 'Q' (for charge only) after the TWO, Full
solver routines are identified with an underscore '_',
Electron-current-only routines are identified with an 'N', and
Hole-current-only routines are identified with a 'P'.
