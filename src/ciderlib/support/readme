Directory: support
------------------
This directory contains the files that support the device simulators and
their interfaces to the circuit simulators.  They fall into four basic
areas:
  1. Numerical algorithms: integration, accuracy limits, special functions
  2. Semiconductor device physics: material properties, recombination, mobility
  3. File access for input: doping profiles from SUPREMIII, saved states
  4. Miscellaneous: diagnstic I/O, string routines
