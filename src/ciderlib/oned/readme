This directory contains the files that are primarily responsible for
implementing the 1D device simulator.  It also contains files that help
interface the circuit simulator to the device simulator.  Most functions
that are common to all 1D device simulations start with the prefix ONE,
e.g. ONEbiasSolve.  The device-specific routines start with either
NUMD or NBJT, e.g. NUMDadmittance or NBJTproject.  The simulator contains
both a Poisson Solver for equilibrium and a three-equation solver for bias
solutions.  An attempt has been made to keep the function names parallel
in the two portions.  Poisson routines are identified with a 'Q' (for charge
only) after the ONE, and Full solver routines are identified with an
underscore '_'.
