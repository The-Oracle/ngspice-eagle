	* complete.c: Double patch applied, code for Windows support (Holger
	  Vogt) and rework of netBSD support (AMAKAWA Shuhei).
	
	* input.c, lexical.c: Windows support (Holger Vogt patch).  

2001-12-14  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

	* lexical.c, complete.c, complete.h:
	  Patched the code with the one contributed by Charles Williams. The patches
	  addresses some memory leaks.

2000-07-18  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* numparse.c: Updates of header file includes.  Some formatting
	changes.

	* wlist.c: Moved this file to src/misc/wlist.c
	
	* Makefile.am: Removed wlist.c

2000-03-11 Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

	* numparse.c: as wrote in Chris Inbody patch: In numparse.c line
	17 changed the arg type of "num" to double. This (so far :) seems
	to have had no adverse effect.

2000-03-11 Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>
   
	* history.c: applied Chris Inbody <cinbody@cowtown.net> patch. He
	wrote: I had some trouble running ng-spice in batch mode on a
	fairly repetitive job (probably 10 - 20 commands repeated 256
	times in a single session :), it was giving me "mangled history"
	errors and then seg faulting.

	[...]  In history.c line 425, added an exit(0) call to the else
	condition to prevent seg fault upon generation of the history list
	error. On line 25, changed cp_maxhistlength to 10000 vs 1000. The
	value of 10000 was enough to keep my task from crashing but there
	may be a better way to do this,.. I didn't try an arbitrarily high
	number because I'm not sure what effect it would have on memory
	usage or progam size or speed. Maybe that's the best answer, just
	bump the value to 1e6 or something that no one would ever
	approach.

1999-09-07  Arno  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>
