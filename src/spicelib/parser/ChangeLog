	* Added explanatory comments to many files.
	
2000-10-12  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* inpeval.c: Bugfix for subcircuits contributed by Michael
	Widlok.

2000-09-09  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* inp2dot.c: Removed unused static functions dot_ic and
	dot_nodeset.

	* inppas2.c: Added back parsing for dotlines.

2000-09-02  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>
	
 	* Patched with code sent by Alan Gillespie. See more on top level
	ChangeLog.

2000-07-07  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* circuit/inp2b.c, circuit/inp2c.c, circuit/inp2d.c,
	circuit/inp2dot.c, circuit/inp2e.c, circuit/inp2f.c,
	circuit/inp2g.c, circuit/inp2h.c, circuit/inp2i.c,
	circuit/inp2j.c, circuit/inp2k.c, circuit/inp2l.c,
	circuit/inp2m.c, circuit/inp2o.c, circuit/inp2q.c,
	circuit/inp2r.c, circuit/inp2s.c, circuit/inp2t.c,
	circuit/inp2u.c, circuit/inp2v.c, circuit/inp2w.c,
	circuit/inp2z.c: Added ; after macros.

2000-05-22  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

	* inp2dot.c: Applied Widlok patch.

	* inpdoopt.c: Applied Widolok patch:commented the entire function,
	seems obsolete.

	* inpptree.c, ptfuncs.c: Applied Widlok patch. Now there is a new
	step function called u2.

2000-04-04  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>
    
	* inpfindl.c: Modified the file for BSIM4 and future extensions to
                      BSIM5 and BSIM6. I have merged the inpfindl.c coming 
		      with the BSIM4 distribution.

	* inp2r.c:    Added acval=val to initialize the acval parameter to
	              a significative value. Hope does not brak anything. 

	* inp2m.c:    Added BSIM4 support.

	* inpdomod.c: Added support for BSIM4 device model.

2000-03-28  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

	* ptfuncs.c: I have applied a couple of patches by GLAO Dezay. He
	noted that PTln, PTlog and PTsqrt returned non consistent values
	if the argument was out of domain. If arg <0 they returned
	f(-arg). The patch is masked by #ifdef EXPERIMENTAL_CODE.  You
	have to remove these lines or #define it to compile Dezai's
	patched code.

2000-03-11 Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

	* inp2dot.c: Applied Glao Dezai patch, adding which = -1 in the
	.sens code.
 
2000-01-17 Paolo Nenzi  <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

	* inp2m.c, inpdomod.c: Inserted code to dupport BSIM3V1 model as
	level 49.
	
2000-01-16 Paolo Nenzi  <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

	* inp2r.c: Modified resistor code. Added instance parameter ac ,
	from Serban Popescu contributed sources.

2000-01-15  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

        * inp2m.c, inpdomod.c: Inserted code to support BSIM3V2 model as
	level 50.

1999-12-20  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

        * inpgtok.c, inpptree.c: Bug Fix
        
	Bug: Scale factors (eg. m, k, meg, etc.) for constants in
	arbitrary source (b devices) are not recognized.
        
	Fix: Changes to inpgtok.c and inpptree.c, as supplied by Berkeley.
        
	NOTE: These changes were orignally supplied to me as a patch to
	3e2 by Beorn Johnson who was maintaining Spice a while back.  They
	were supposed to have been incorporated in Spice 3f2 at that time,
	but are missing from the 3f5 version that I recently got from
	Berkeley.  I don't know if they were removed in ignorance or
	because of a conflict with some other requirement, but they appear
	to work in 3f5.  ALSO, the fix for 3e2 had many more changes, all
	of which remain in 3f5, so don't try these alone on 3e2.
 
1999-09-07  Arno  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* inpsymt.c: removed unused function prototype for local_remove().

	* sperror.c: removed unused variable `notempty'

1999-09-05  Emmanuel Rouat  <emmanuel.rouat@wanadoo.fr>

	* inpptree.c (PTdifferentiate): removed superfluous argument to 2
	occurences of function mkf

	* *.c: put all function prototypes in inp.h 

1999-08-28  Emmanuel Rouat  <emmanuel.rouat@wanadoo.fr>

	* Removed all #includes of misc.h and util.h (now in spice.h)

1999-08-24  Paolo Nenzi <pnenzi@ieee.ing.uniroma1.it>

	* inpdomod.c: added level check for ps model, jfet level 2

	* inp2j.c: added code for ps model, jfet level 2

1999-08-08  Emmanuel Rouat  <emmanuel.rouat@wanadoo.fr>

	* inp2dot.c (INP2dot):changed HAS_SENSE2 in WANT_SENSE2 

1999-08-03  Emmanuel Rouat  <emmanuel.rouat@wanadoo.fr>

	* ptfuncs.c: changed HAS_ATRIGH to HAVE_ACOSH,HAVE_ASINH and
	HAVE_ATANH provided in config.h
