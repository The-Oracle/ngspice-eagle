2001-12-04  Emmanuel Rouat  <emmanuel.rouat@wanadoo.fr>

	* maths/cmaths/Makefile.am (noinst_PROGRAMS): test programs
	shouldnt get installed

2000-10-13  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* ngspice.txt: changes SPICE: to NGSPICE: to restore help
	functionality.  Thanks go to Michael Widlok for the analysis.

2000-07-21  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* src/analysis/*: Moved these files into src/devices/analysis.
	The files in this directory implement the analysis and simulation
	for electrical circuits.

	This is the final step to separating the Spice sources into a
	library part and a frontend part.  Now, the devices subdirectory
	has to be renamed to spicelib and the devices that are now
	scattered in that directory should be moved into a new devices
	directory.

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/devices/Makefile.am: Files
	affected by the move.
	
2000-07-20  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* src/hlp/*: moved these files into src/frontend/help.  The files
	in this directory implement the help system for the frontend.

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/frontend/Makefile.am: Files
	affected by the move.

	* src/circuit/*: moved these files into src/devices/parser.  The
	files in this directory take a model line from the input file and
	add the corresponding element to the representation of
	the circuit in memory.

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/devices/Makefile.am: Files
	affected by the move.

2000-07-18  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* main.c: Added the call to the initialization function of the
	devices.

2000-07-07  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* parser/cshpar.c: Separated out com_chdir(), com_echo(),
	com_rehash() and com_shell() and moved them into frontend
	directory.

	* frontend/com_chdir.c, frontend/com_echo.c, frontend/com_rehash.c,
	frontend/com_shell.c: Their new homes.

	* parser/quote.c, parser/quote.h: The quote/unquote functions are
	used exclusively in the frontend, moved them there.

	* frontend/quote.c, frontend/quote.h: Their new location.

	* parser/input.c, parser/input.h: Input, output and error streams
	handled in the frontend.  Moved to the frontend directory.

	* frontend/streams.c: Its new home.
	
	* frontend/Makefile.am: Updates for new files.

	* frontend/breakp2.c, frontend/newcoms.c, frontend/postcoms.c,
	frontend/resource.c, frontend/terminal.h, frontend/variable.c,
	frontend/variable.h, frontend/com_compose.c,
	frontend/com_display.c, frontend/com_setscale.c,
	frontend/com_strcmp.c: Include files update.

	* parser/var2.c, parser/var2.h: Empty files, removed.

	* parser/Makefile.am: Updates for removed files.

	* parser/lexical.c: Small adjustments

	* ngspice.c: Added support for BSIM4.
	
	* Makefile.am: Added support for bsim4 shared library.

2000-01-14  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

	* conf.c: inserted definitions for bsim3v2 and bsim3v1 devices.
 	It is necessary to include old models for commercially available
	components libraries.
	
1999-12-01  Emmanuel Rouat  <emmanuel.rouat@wanadoo.fr>
