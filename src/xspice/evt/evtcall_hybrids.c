SUMMARY

    This file contains function EVTcall_hybrids which calls all models
    which have both analog and event-driven ports.  It is called following
    successful evaluation of an analog iteration attempt to allow
    events to be scheduled by the hybrid models.  The 'CALL_TYPE' is set
    to 'EVENT_DRIVEN' when the model is called from this function.

INTERFACES

    void EVTcall_hybrids(CKTcircuit *ckt)
