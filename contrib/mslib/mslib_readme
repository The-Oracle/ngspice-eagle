Mslib can create a small tmp library which can be .include to spice deck or
used as tmp file with libprm.
You invoke it like this: mslib deck_name [tmp_lib_name]. If second argument
is not given mslib uses deck_name.lib. Mslib then reads deck and looks for
special commands in it. This commands are:

*SUB name1 name2 ... - what subckts are used
*MOD name1 name2 ... - what models are used
*LIB name1 name2 ... - what libraries should be searched

You can give full path for libraries or just the name. Mslib tries to
find them in current directory and then in directory specified in datadef.h
file. There are also some other default options defined there. Check them 
After all a tmp. library for the deck is created. It consist only the models 
and subckts that were specified in *MOD and *SUB commands. 



This is all. 
Mslib is _NOT_ a good program. It should automatically recognize what models
or subckts were used and it should be written with flex or bison. Now it
just indicates what is my level of programming in C. 
There are some options that You can set for mslib in datadef.h. I tried to 
document all of them there, so when want to know more look to the sources.

And one more thing. There is a perl program "spiceprm" that lets You use
parameters in subckts. Many Intusoft's libraries use this feature. To use
parameters I have written a small shell script "libprm". This program
automatic runs spiceprm and mslib on Your's deck to give a working spice
input file. To see how this all works please read "libprm_readme" and 
spiceprm readme.
